# Contrastive fitted Q-iteration: off-policy reinforcement learning for case-control environments
![Build Status](https://github.com/bee-hive/contrastive-rl/actions/workflows/crl_workflow.yml/badge.svg)

This repository is the official implementation of [Contrastive fitted Q-iteration: off-policy reinforcement learning for case-control environments](https://neurips.cc/).

Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be a powerful framework for guiding agents' actions in environments with stochastic rewards and unknown or noisy state dynamics. In many real-world settings, these agents are acting in distinct types of environments, each of whose dynamics differ slightly. For example, we may be interested in developing policies guiding medical treatment for patients with and without a given disease, or policies to navigate curriculum design for students with and without a learning disability. Here, we introduce contrastive fitted Q-iteration (CFQI), an off-policy RL framework that finds optimal policies in environments that exhibit this case-control structure. Our approach develops a contrastive Q-value function that leverages the shared structure between the two groups while allowing their policies to be distinct from one another. We find that CFQI yields a policy that relies on relevant features to make predictions; it also performs at least as well as a policy that does not consider group structure, and often much better because of a closer fit to the environments. Furthermore, CFQI is robust to imbalance in group sample sizes and outperforms other bespoke approaches for similar tasks, including warm start and transfer learning methods. We demonstrate the performance of CFQI using an OpenAI Gym environment and a clinical decision-making RL task.

## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In this repository, we demonstrate how to reproduce results on an OpenAI gym environment. We include code but do not include instructions for preprocessing MIMIC-IV since it is a semi-private dataset available only to authorized users.

## Training

All of the algorithms in this paper are available in simulated_fqi/train.py. To run each of the algorithms (CFQI, FQI, Warm Start, Transfer Learning):

```train
python train.py fqi
python train.py cfqi
python train.py warm_start
python train.py transfer_learning
```

## Evaluation

### Cartpole

CFQI can be evaluated and benchmarked against competing methods in several different settings in the Cartpole environment. Our experiments include testing:

- Overall cumulative reward as the leftward force varies (`simulated_experiments/test_force_range.py`)
- Interpretability using SHAP values (`simulated_experiments/notebooks/neurips_experiments.ipynb`)
- Performance when no difference exists between foreground and background (`simulated_experiments/shuffle_test.py`)
- Performance with sample size imbalance between the foreground and background (`simulated_experiments/sample_size_experiment.py`)

Each of these experiments corresponds to a `.py` file in the `simulated_experiments` directory. Each experiment can be run by calling its respective file. For example, to run the sample size experiment, one can run the following command from a terminal:

`python sample_size_experiment.py`

Each of these experiments outputs a `.json` file containing the results. The plots can be generated using the correspoding files in the `simulated_experiments/plotting` directory.

### MIMIC-IV
We evaluate CFQI on MIMIC-IV by first training CFQI on our MDP as described in the paper. We then evaluate it by generating SHAP plots for renal and non-renal patients and by identifying which
actions are most common. These experimments can be seen in experimental_fqi/mimic-iv_experiments.ipynb. We do not include data or data preprocessing steps because the MIMIC-IV dataset is semi-private.

## Results

As an example of our results, we show the outcome of the "cumulative reward" experiment in the cartpole environment below (please see paper for full results). We find that CFQI outperforms three competing methods (FQI, warm start, and transfer learning) in both the foreground and background environments.
